# Edward the Second notes

## Random annotation and stuff

* T632: I'm actually a bit confused about the relationship between the
        Queen, Lancaster, and the Young Mortimer... I thought they were
        united against Gaveston or something?
* T641: Sorry, what does "repeal" mean? Why does Mortimer want to repeal
        Gaveston's exile, if that's what "repeal" refers to?
* T651: What does "resolv'd" mean?
* Wait, Mortimer and the Queen potentially having an affair? Huh.
* L500: ?
* L577: Who is King Edward trying to engage Gaveston with?
        Alight, "Margaret". I wonder who that is, though.

## Status in Early Modern England

The crisis of aristocracy: When the king has his own army, how can the
nobility remain noble? They start seeing themselves as *advisors* and
prove themselv through education, and they are therefore worried about
the nobility that are uneducated.

### Exploration of the Americas

* England experienced an explosion in population (2M -> 6M) as potatoes
  and other crops are introduced after the Exploration. The massive
  increased in population causes instability in the urban system.

* England doesn't have a bearucreacy. The local order is kept by the
  nobility; the government itself is patently poor because of England's
  strange system of taxation.

* During Elizabeth, fourteen noble families expired and 60 peers went
  unrewarded between 1590 and 1603.

* Fear of rising non-elite/gentlemanly class in their ability to
  self-fashion to courtly standards; books on "how to behave like part
  of the nobility".
