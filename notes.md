# Edward the Second notes

## Random annotation and stuff

* T632: I'm actually a bit confused about the relationship between the
  Queen, Lancaster, and the Young Mortimer... I thought they were united
  against Gaveston or something?

* T641: Sorry, what does "repeal" mean? Why does Mortimer want to repeal
  Gaveston's exile, if that's what "repeal" refers to?

* T651: What does "resolv'd" mean?

* Wait, Mortimer and the Queen potentially having an affair? Huh.

* L500: ?

* L577: Who is King Edward trying to engage Gaveston with? Alight,
  "Margaret". I wonder who that is, though.

## Status in Early Modern England

The crisis of aristocracy: When the king has his own army, how can the
nobility remain noble? They start seeing themselves as *advisors* and
prove themselv through education, and they are therefore worried about
the nobility that are uneducated.

* England experienced an explosion in population (2M -> 6M) as potatoes
  and other crops are introduced after the Exploration of the Americas.
  The massive increased in population causes instability in the urban
  system.

* England doesn't have a bearucreacy. The local order is kept by the
  nobility; the government itself is patently poor because of England's
  strange system of taxation.

* During Elizabeth, fourteen noble families expired and 60 peers went
  unrewarded between 1590 and 1603.

* Fear of rising non-elite/gentlemanly class in their ability to
  self-fashion to courtly standards; books on "how to behave like part
  of the nobility".

* Should kings have friendship?

* Civic humanism: Job is to serve the state; gone out of fashion,
  replaced with neostoicism.

* The trope of "the [king's] favorite": No philosophical basis,
  self-obsessed, can't control their sexual desires, pitied and envied
  The flatterer

* Fear of the other (both in the military and in terms of social order)

* Everyone goes to theatres; they are important as that's where most
  people encountered intellectual ideas.

* One and only one "friendship" incl. physical intimacy

* The concept of homosexuality came into play in the Victorian era

* Sodomy is "any sexual act not between 'a man and his wife'"

* Homosexuality and effiminacy were not associated at the time.

* Why didn't they justify patriarchy by saying women were weaker? "Women
  exist to disrupt male authority; women as the 'other'."   
  Guidebooks (written by men of course): The worst thing you could do is
  to be in love with your wife.   
  Cuckoldery is considered one of the worst things.
