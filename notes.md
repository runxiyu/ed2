T632: I'm actually a bit confused about the relationship between the
      Queen, Lancaster, and the Young Mortimer... I thought they were
      united against Gaveston or something?
T641: Sorry, what does "repeal" mean? Why does Mortimer want to repeal
      Gaveston's exile, if that's what "repeal" refers to?
T651: What does "resolv'd" mean?
Wait, Mortimer and the Queen potentially having an affair? Huh.

L500: ?
L577: Who is King Edward trying to engage Gaveston with?
      Alight, "Margaret". I wonder who that is, though.
