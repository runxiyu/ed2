&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And share the kingdom with thy dearest friend.</i><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ah, words that make me surfeit with delight!<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What greater bliss can hap to Gaveston<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Than live and be the favourite of a king!<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sweet prince, I come! these, thy amorous lines<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Might have enforc'd me to have swum from France,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, like Leander, gasp'd upon the sand,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So thou wouldst smile, and take me in thine arms.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sight of London to my exil'd eyes<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is as Elysium to a new-come soul:<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not that I love the city or the men,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But that it harbours him I hold so dear,—<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The king, upon whose bosom let me lie,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And with the world be still at enmity.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What need the arctic people love star-light,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To whom the sun shines both by day and night?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Farewell base stooping to the lordly peers!<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My knee shall bow to none but to the king.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the multitude, that are but sparks,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rak'd up in embers of their poverty,—<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Tanti,</i>—I'll fawn first on the wind,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That glanceth at my lips, and flieth away.<br>
</p>

<p id="id00008">                <i>Enter three</i> Poor Men.</p>

<p id="id00009">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But how now! what are these?<br>

<i>Poor Men.</i> Such as desire your worship's service.<br>

<i>Gav.</i> What canst thou do?<br>

<i>First P. Man.</i> I can ride.<br>

<i>Gav.</i> But I have no horse.—What art thou?<br>

<i>Sec. P. Man.</i> A traveller.<br>

<i>Gav.</i> Let me see; thou wouldst do well<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To wait at my trencher, and tell me lies at dinner-time;<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, as I like your discoursing, I'll have you.—<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And what art thou?<br>

<i>Third P. Man.</i> A soldier, that hath serv'd against the Scot.<br>

<i>Gav.</i> Why, there are hospitals for such as you:<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have no war; and therefore, sir, be gone.<br>

<i>Third P. Man.</i> Farewell, and perish by a soldier's hand,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That wouldst reward them with an hospital!<br>

<i>Gav.</i> Ay, ay, these words of his move me as much<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As if a goose should play the porcupine,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And dart her plumes, thinking to pierce my breast.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But yet it is no pain to speak men fair;<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'll flatter these, and make them live in hope.—            [<i>Aside.</i><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You know that I came lately out of France,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And yet I have not view'd my lord the king:<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If I speed well, I'll entertain you all.<br>

<i>All.</i> We thank your worship.<br>

<i>Gav.</i> I have some business: leave me to myself.<br>

<i>All.</i> We will wait here about the court.<br>

<i>Gav.</i> Do.                                            [<i>Exeunt Poor Men.</i><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are not men for me;<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I must have wanton poets, pleasant wits,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Musicians, that with touching of a string<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May draw the pliant king which way I please:<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Music and poetry is his delight;<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore I'll have Italian masks by night,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sweet speeches, comedies, and pleasing shows;<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And in the day, when he shall walk abroad,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like sylvan nymphs my pages shall be clad;<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My men, like satyrs grazing on the lawns,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shall with their goat-feet dance the antic hay;<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sometime a lovely boy in Dian's shape,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With hair that gilds the water as it glides<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Crownets of pearl about his naked arms,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And in his sportful hands an olive-tree,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To hide those parts which men delight to see,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shall bathe him in a spring; and there, hard by,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One like Actæon, peeping through the grove,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shall by the angry goddess be transform'd,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And running in the likeness of an hart,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By yelping hounds pull'd down, shall semm to die:<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such things as these best please his majesty.—<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here comes my lord the king, and the nobles,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the parliament.  I'll stand aside.                    [<i>Retires.</i><br>
</p>

<p id="id00010"><i>Enter</i> KING EDWARD, KENT, LANCASTER, <i>the elder</i> MORTIMER,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>the younger</i> MORTIMER, WARWICK, PEMBROKE, <i>and</i><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Attendants.<br>
</p>

<p id="id00011"><i>K. Edw.</i> Lancaster!<br>

<i>Lan.</i> My lord?<br>

<i>Gav.</i> That Earl of Lancaster do I abhor.                       [<i>Aside.</i><br>

<i>K. Edw.</i> Will you not grant me this?—In spite of them<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'll have my will; and these two Mortimers,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That cross me thus, shall know I am displeased.              [<i>Aside.</i><br>

<i>E. Mor.</i> If you love us, my lord, hate Gaveston.<br>

<i>Gav.</i> That villain Mortimer! I'll be his death.                [<i>Aside.</i><br>

__Y. Mor._ Mine uncle here, this earl, and I myself,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Were sworn to your father at his death,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That he should ne'er return into the realm:<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And now, my lord, ere I will break my oath,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This sword of mine, that should offend your foes,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shall sleep within the scabbard at thy need,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And underneath thy banners march who will,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For Mortimer will hang his armour up.<br>

<i>Gav. Mort dieu!</i>                                               [<i>Aside.</i><br>

<i>K. Edw.</i> Well, Mortimer, I'll make thee rue these words:<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beseems it thee to contradict thy king?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Frown'st thou thereat, aspiring Lancaster?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sword shall plane the furrows of thy brows,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And hew these knees that now are grown so stiff.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will have Gaveston; and you shall know<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What danger 'tis to stand against your king.<br>

<i>Gav.</i> Well done, Ned!                                          [<i>Aside.</i><br>

<i>Lan.</i> My lord, why do you thus incense your peers,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That naturally would love and honour you,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But for that base and obscure Gaveston?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Four earldoms have I, besides Lancaster,—<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Derby, Salisbury, Lincoln, Leicester;<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These will I sell, to give my soldiers pay,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ere Gaveston shall stay within the realm:<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, if he be come, expel him straight.<br>

<i>Kent.</i> Barons and earls, your pride hath made me mute;<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But know I'll speak, and to the proof, I hope.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do remember, in my father's days,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lord Percy of the North, being highly mov'd,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brav'd Mowbray in presence of the king;<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For which, had not his highness lov'd him well,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He should have lost his head; but with his look<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Th' undaunted spirit of Percy was appeas'd,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Mowbray and he were reconcil'd:<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet dare you brave the king unto his face.—<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brother, revenge it, and let these their heads<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Preach upon poles, for trespass of their tongues.<br>

<i>War.</i> O, our heads!<br>

<i>K. Edw.</i> Ay, yours; and therefore I would wish you grant.<br>

<i>War.</i> Bridle thy anger, gentle Mortimer.<br>

<i>Y. Mor.</i> I cannot, nor I will not; I must speak.—<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cousin, our hands I hope shall fence our heads,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And strike off his that makes you threaten us.—<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Come, uncle, let us leave the brain-sick king,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And henceforth parley with our naked swords.<br>

<i>E. Mor.</i> Wiltshire hath men enough to save our heads.<br>

<i>War.</i> All Warwickshire will leave him for my sake.<br>

<i>Lan.</i> And northward Lancaster hath many friends.—<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Adieu, my lord; and either change your mind,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or look to see the throne, where you should sit,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To float in blood, and at thy wanton head<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The glozing head of thy base minion thrown.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>Exeunt all except King Edward, Kent, Gaveston,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and attendants.</i><br>

<i>K. Edw.</i> I cannot brook these haughty menaces:<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Am I a king, and must be over-rul'd!—<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brother, display my ensigns in the field:<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'll bandy with the barons and the earls,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And either die or live with Gaveston.<br>

<i>Gav.</i> I can no longer keep me from my lord.            [<i>Comes forward.</i><br>

<i>K. Edw.</i> What, Gaveston! welcome!  Kiss not my hand:<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Embrace me, Gaveston, as I do thee.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why shouldst thou kneel? know'st thou not who I am?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thy friend, thyself, another Gaveston:<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not Hylas was more mourned for of Hercules<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Than thou hast been of me since thy exile.<br>

<i>Gav.</i> And, since I went from hence, no soul in hell<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hath felt more torment than poor Gaveston.<br>

<i>K. Edw.</i> I know it.—Brother, welcome home my friend.—<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now let the treacherous Mortimers conspire,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And that high-minded Earl of Lancaster:<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have my wish, in that I joy thy sight;<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And sooner shall the sea o'erwhelm my land<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Than bear the ship that shall transport thee hence.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I here create thee Lord High-chamberlain,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chief Secretary to the state and me,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Earl of Cornwall, King and Lord of Man.<br>

<i>Gav.</i> My lord, these titles far exceed my worth.<br>

<i>Kent.</i> Brother, the least of these may well suffice<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For one of greater birth than Gaveston.<br>

<i>K. Edw.</i> Cease, brother, for I cannot brook these words.—<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thy worth, sweet friend, is far above my gifts:<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, to equal it, receive my heart.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If for these dignities thou be envied,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'll give thee more; for, but to honour thee,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is Edward pleas'd with kingly regiment.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fear'st thou thy person? thou shalt have a guard:<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wantest thou gold? go to my treasury:<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wouldst thou be lov'd and fear'd? receive my seal,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Save or condemn, and in our name command<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What so thy mind affects, or fancy likes.<br>

<i>Gav.</i> It shall suffice me to enjoy your love;<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which whiles I have, I think myself as great<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Cæsar riding in the Roman street,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With captive kings at his triumphant car.<br>

<p id="id00013"><i>K. Edw.</i> Whither goes my Lord of Coventry so fast?
<i>Bish. of Cov.</i> To celebrate your father's exequies.
   But is that wicked Gaveston return'd?
<i>K. Edw.</i> Ay, priest, and lives to be reveng'd on thee,
   That wert the only cause of his exile.
<i>Gav.</i> 'Tis true; and, but for reverence of these robes,
   Thou shouldst not plod one foot beyond this place.
<i>Bish. of Cov.</i> I did no more than I was bound to do:
   And, Gaveston, unless thou be reclaim'd,
   As then I did incense the parliament,
   So will I now, and thou shalt back to France.
<i>Gav.</i> Saving your reverence, you must pardon me.
<i>K. Edw.</i> Throw off his golden mitre, rend his stole,
   And in the channel christen him anew.
<i>Kent.</i> Ay, brother, lay not violent hands on him!
   For he'll complain unto the see of Rome.
<i>Gav.</i> Let him complain unto the see of hell:
   I'll be reveng'd on him for my exile.
<i>K. Edw.</i> No, spare his life, but seize upon his goods:
   Be thou lord bishop, and receive his rents,
   And make him serve thee as thy chaplain:
   I give him thee; here, use him as thou wilt.
<i>Gav.</i> He shall to prison, and there die in bolts.
<i>K. Edw.</i> Ay, to the Tower, the Fleet, or where thou wilt.
<i>Bish. of Cov.</i> For this offence be thou accurs'd of God!
<i>K. Edw.</i> Who's there?  Convey this priest to the Tower.
<i>Bish. of Cov.</i> True, true.
<i>K. Edw.</i> But, in the meantime, Gaveston, away,
   And take possession of his house and goods.
   Come, follow me, and thou shalt have my guard
   To see it done, and bring thee safe again.
<i>Gav.</i> What should a priest do with so fair a house?

<i>War.</i> She smiles: now, for my life, his mind is chang'd!<br>

<i>Lan.</i> I'll rather lose his friendship, I, than grant.<br>

<i>Y. Mor.</i> Well, of necessity it must be so.—<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My lords, that I abhor base Gaveston<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope your honours make no question.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And therefore, though I plead for his repeal,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Tis not for his sake, but to our avail;<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nay, for the realm's behoof, and for the king's.<br>

<i>Lan.</i> Fie, Mortimer, dishonour not thyself!<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can this be true, 'twas good to banish him?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And is this true, to call him home again?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such reasons make white black, and dark night day.<br>

<i>Y. Mor.</i> My Lord of Lancaster, mark the respect.<br>

<i>Lan.</i> In no respect can contraries be true.<br>

<i>Q. Isab.</i> Yet, good my lord, hear what he can allege.<br>

<i>War.</i> All that he speaks is nothing; we are resolv'd.<br>

<i>Y. Mor.</i> Do you not wish that Gaveston were dead?<br>

<i>Pem.</i> I would he were!<br>

<i>Y. Mor.</i> Why, then, my lord, give me but leave to speak.<br>

<i>E. Mor.</i> But, nephew, do not play the sophister.<br>

<i>Y. Mor.</i> This which I urge is of a burning zeal<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To mend the king and do our country good.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Know you not Gaveston hath store of gold,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which may in Ireland purchase him such friends<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As he will front the mightiest of us all?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And whereas he shall live and be belov'd,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Tis hard for us to work his overthrow.<br>

<i>War.</i> Mark you but that, my lord of Lancaster.<br>

<i>Y. Mor.</i> But, were he here, detested as he is,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How easily might some base slave be suborn'd<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To greet his lordship with a poniard,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And none so much as blame the murderer,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But rather praise him for that brave attempt,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And in the chronicle enrol his name<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For purging of the realm of such a plague!<br>

<i>Pem.</i> He saith true.<br>

<i>Lan.</i> Ay, but how chance this was not done before?<br>

<i>Y. Mor.</i> Because, my lords, it was not thought upon.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nay, more, when he shall know it lies in us<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To banish him, and then to call him home,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Twill make him vail the top flag of his pride,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And fear to offend the meanest nobleman.<br>

<i>E. Mor.</i> But how if he do not, nephew?<br>

<i>Y. Mor.</i> Then may we with some colour rise in arms;<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For, howsoever we have borne it out,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Tis treason to be up against the king;<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So shall we have the people of our side,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which, for his father's sake, lean to the king,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But cannot brook a night-grown mushroom,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such a one as my Lord of Cornwall is,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Should bear us down of the nobility:<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, when the commons and the nobles join,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Tis not the king can buckler Gaveston;<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We'll pull him from the strongest hold he hath.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My lords, if to perform this I be slack,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Think me as base a groom as Gaveston.<br>

<i>Lan.</i> On that condition Lancaster will grant.<br>

<i>War.</i> And so will Pembroke and I.<br>

<i>E. Mor.</i> And I.<br>

<i>Y. Mor.</i> In this I count me highly gratified,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Mortimer will rest at your command.<br>

<i>Q. Isab.</i> And when this favour Isabel forgets,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then let her live abandon'd and forlorn.—<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But see, in happy time, my lord the king,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having brought the Earl of Cornwall on his way,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is new return'd.  This news will glad him much:<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet not so much as me; I love him more<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Than he can Gaveston: would he lov'd me<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But half so much! then were I treble-blest.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thou seest by nature he is mild and calm;<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, seeing his mind so dotes on Gaveston,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let him without controlment have his will.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mightiest kings have had their minions;<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Great Alexander lov'd Hephæstion,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The conquering Hercules for Hylas wept,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And for Patroclus stern Achilles droop'd<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And not kings only, but the wisest men;<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Roman Tully lov'd Octavius,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grave Socrates wild Alcibiades.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And promiseth as much as we can wish,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Freely enjoy that vain light-headed earl;<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For riper years will wean him from such toys.<br>

<i>Y. Mor.</i> Uncle, his wanton humour grieves not me;<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But this I scorn, that one so basely-born<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Should by his sovereign's favour grow so pert,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And riot it with the treasure of the realm,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While soldiers mutiny for want of pay.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He wears a lord's revenue on his back,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, Midas-like, he jets it in the court,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With base outlandish cullions at his heels,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whose proud fantastic liveries make such show<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As if that Proteus, god of shapes, appear'd.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have not seen a dapper Jack so brisk:<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He wears a short Italian hooded cloak,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Larded with pearl, and in his Tuscan cap<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A jewel of more value than the crown.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While others walk below, the king and he,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From out a window, laugh at such as we,<br>

<p id="id00036">        <i>Enter the younger</i> SPENSER <i>and</i> BALDOCK.</p>

<p id="id00037"><i>Bald.</i> Spenser,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing that our lord the Earl of Glocester's dead,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which of the nobles dost thou mean to serve?<br>

<i>Y. Spen.</i> Not Mortimer, nor any of his side,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because the king and he are enemies.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Baldock, learn this of me: a factious lord<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shall hardly do himself good, much less us;<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he that hath the favour of a king<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May with one word advance us while we live.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The liberal Earl of Cornwall is the man<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On whose good fortune Spenser's hope depends.<br>

<i>Bald.</i> What, mean you, then, to be his follower?<br>

<i>Y. Spen.</i> No, his companion; for he loves me well,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And would have once preferr'd me to the king.<br>

<i>Bald.</i> But he is banish'd; there's small hope of him.<br>

<i>Y. Spen.</i> Ay, for a while; but, Baldock, mark the end.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A friend of mine told me in secrecy<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That he's repeal'd and sent for back again;<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And even now a post came from the court<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With letters to our lady from the king;<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, as she read, she smil'd; which makes me think<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is about her lover Gaveston.<br>

<i>Bald.</i> 'Tis like enough; for, since he was exil'd,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She neither walks abroad nor comes in sight.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I had thought the match had been broke off,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And that his banishment had chang'd her mind.<br>

<i>Y. Spen.</i> Our lady's first love is not wavering;<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My life for thine, she will have Gaveston.<br>

<i>Bald.</i> Then hope I by her means to be preferr'd,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having read unto her since she was a child.<br>

<i>Y. Spen.</i> Then, Baldock, you must cast the scholar off,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And learn to court it like a gentleman.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Tis not a black coat and a little band,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A velvet-cap'd cloak, fac'd before with serge,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And smelling to a nosegay all the day,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or holding of a napkin in your hand,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or saying a long grace at a table's end,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or making low legs to a nobleman,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or looking downward, with your eye-lids close,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And saying, "Truly, an't may please your honour,"<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can get you any favour with great men:<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You must be proud, bold, pleasant, resolute,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And now and then stab, as occasion serves.<br>

<i>Bald.</i> Spenser, thou know'st I hate such formal toys,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And use them but of mere hypocrisy.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mine old lord, whiles he liv'd, was so precise,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That he would take exceptions at my buttons,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, being like pins' heads, blame me for the bigness;<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which made me curate-like in mine attire,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though inwardly licentious enough,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And apt for any kind of villany.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am none of these common pedants, I,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That cannot speak without <i>propterea quod.</i><br>

<i>Y. Spen.</i> But one of those that saith <i>quando-quidem,</i><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And hath a special gift to form a verb.<br>

   Dear shall you both abide this riotous deed:
   Out of my presence! come not near the court.
<i>Y. Mor.</i> I'll not be barr'd the court for Gaveston.

   But, if I live, I'll tread upon their heads
   That think with high looks thus to tread me down.
   Come, Edmund, let's away, and levy men:
   'Tis war that must abate these barons' pride.

<i>Y. Mor.</i> Mov'd may he be, and perish in his wrath!
<i>Lan.</i> Cousin, it is no dealing with him now;
   He means to make us stoop by force of arms:
   And therefore let us jointly here protest
   To prosecute that Gaveston to the death.
<i>Y. Mor.</i> By heaven, the abject villain shall not live!
<i>War.</i> I'll have his blood, or die in seeking it.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stately and proud in riches and in train,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whilom I was, powerful and full of pomp:<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But what is he whom rule and empery<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Come, Spenser,—come, Baldock,—come, sit down by me;<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Make trial now of that philosophy<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That in our famous nurseries of arts<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thou suck'dst from Plato and from Aristotle.—<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Father, this life contemplative is heaven:<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O, that I might this life in quiet lead!<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But we, alas, are chas'd!—and you, my friends,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your lives and my dishonour they pursue.—<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who wounds me with the name of Mortimer,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That bloody man?—Good father, on thy lap<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are depriv'd the sunshine of our life.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Make for a new life, man; throw up thy eyes<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And heart and hand to heaven's immortal throne;<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pay nature's debt with cheerful countenance;<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WINCHESTER, <i>and</i> TRUSSEL.<br>
</p>

<p id="id00116"><i>Leices.</i> Be patient, good my lord, cease to lament;<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Imagine Killingworth Castle were your court,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And that you lay for pleasure here a space,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not of compulsion or necessity.<br>

<i>K. Edw.</i> Leicester, if gentle words might comfort me,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thy speeches long ago had eas'd my sorrows,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For kind and loving hast thou always been.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The griefs of private men are soon allay'd;<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But not of kings.  The forest deer, being struck,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Runs to an herb that closeth up the wounds:<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But when the imperial lion's flesh is gor'd,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He rends and tears it with his wrathful paw,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[And], highly scorning that the lowly earth<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Should drink his blood, mounts up to the air:<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And so it fares with me, whose dauntless mind<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Th' ambitious Mortimer would seek to curb,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And that unnatural queen, false Isabel,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That thus hath pent and mew'd me in a prison<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For such outrageous passions cloy my soul,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As with the wings of rancour and disdain<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Full oft[ten] am I soaring up to heaven,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To plain me to the gods against them both.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But when I call to mind I am a king,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Methinks I should revenge me of my wrongs,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That Mortimer and Isabel have done.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But what are kings, when regiment is gone,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But perfect shadows in a sunshine day?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My nobles rule; I bear the name of king,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wear the crown; but am controll'd by them,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By Mortimer, and my unconstant queen,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who spots my nuptial bed with infamy;<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whilst I am lodg'd within this cave of care,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where sorrow at my elbow still attends,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To company my heart with sad laments,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That bleeds within me for this strange exchange.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But tell me, must I now resign my crown,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To make usurping Mortimer a king?<br>

<i>Bish. of Win.</i> Your grace mistakes; it is for England's good,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And princely Edward's right, we crave the crown.<br>

<i>K. Edw.</i> No, 'tis for Mortimer, not Edward's head<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For he's a lamb, emcompassed by wolves,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which in a moment will abridge his life.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, if proud Mortimer do wear this crown,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heavens turn it to a blaze of quenchless fire!<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or, like the snaky wreath of Tisiphon,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Engirt the temples of his hateful head!<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So shall not England's vine be perished,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Edward's name survive, though Edward dies.<br>

<i>Leices.</i> My lord, why waste you thus the time away?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They stay your answer: will you yield your crown?<br>

<i>K. Edw.</i> Ah, Leicester, weigh how hardly I can brook<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To lose my crown and kingdom without cause;<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To give ambitious Mortimer my right,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That, like a mountain, overwhelms my bliss;<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In which extreme my mind here murder'd is!<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But that the heavens appoint I must obey.—<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here, take my crown; the life of Edward too:  [<i>Taking off the crown.</i><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two kings in England cannot reign at once.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But stay a while: let me be king till night,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That I may gaze upon this glittering crown;<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So shall my eyes receive their last content,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My head, the latest honour due to it,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And jointly both yield up their wished right.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Continue ever, thou celestial sun;<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let never silent night possess this clime;<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stand still, you watches of the element;<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All times and seasons, rest you at a stay,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That Edward may be still fair England's king!<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But day's bright beams doth vanish fast away,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And needs I must resign my wished crown.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Inhuman creatures, nurs'd with tiger's milk,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why gape you for your sovereign's overthrow?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My diadem, I mean, and guiltless life.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;See, monsters, see! I'll wear my crown again.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
[<i>Putting on the crown.</i><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What, fear you not the fury of your king?—<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, hapless Edward, thou art fondly led;<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They pass not for thy frowns as late they did,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But seek to make a new-elected king;<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which fills my mind with strange despairing thoughts,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which thoughts are martyred with endless torments;<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And in this torment comfort find I none,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But that I feel the crown upon my head;<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And therefore let me wear it yet a while.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And therefore say, will you resign or no?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then send for unrelenting Mortimer,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Isabel, whose eyes being turn'd to steel<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Will sooner sparkle fire than shed a tear.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet stay; for, rather than I'll look on them,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here, here! [<i>Gives the crown.</i>]—Now, sweet God of heaven,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Make me despise this transitory pomp,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And sit fot aye enthronised in heaven!<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ah, pardon me! grief makes me lunatic.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let not that Mortimer protect my son;<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More safety there is in a tiger's jaws<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Than his embracements.  Bear this to the queen,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wet with my tears, and dried again with sighs:<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Better than I: yet how have I transgress'd,<br>

<i>Light.</i> To comfort you, and bring you joyful news.<br>

<i>K. Edw.</i> Small comfort finds poor Edward in thy looks:<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Villain, I know thou com'st to murder me.<br>

<i>Light.</i> To murder you, my most gracious lord?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Far is it from my heart to do you harm.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The queen sent me to see how you were us'd,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For she relents at this your misery:<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And what eye can refrain from shedding tears,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To see a king in this most piteous state?<br>

<i>K. Edw.</i> Weep'st thou already? list a while to me,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then thy heart, were it as Gurney's is,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or as Matrevis', hewn from the Caucasus,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet will it melt ere I have done my tale.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This dungeon where they keep me is the sink<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wherein the filth of all the castle falls.<br>

<i>Light.</i> O villains!<br>

<i>K. Edw.</i> And there, in mire and puddle, have I stood<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This ten days' space; and, lest that I should sleep,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One plays continually upon a drum;<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They give me bread and water, being a king;<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So that, for want of sleep and sustenance,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My mind's distemper'd, and my body's numb'd,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And whether I have limbs or no I know not.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O, would my blood dropp'd out from every vein,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As doth this water from my tatter'd robes!<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tell Isabel the queen, I look'd not thus,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When for her sake I ran at tilt in France,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And there unhors'd the Duke of Cleremont.<br>

<i>Light.</i> O, speak no more, my lord! this breaks my heart.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lie on this bed, and rest yourself a while.<br>

<i>K. Edw.</i> These looks of thine can harbour naught but death;<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I see my tragedy written in thy brows.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet stay a while; forbear thy bloody hand,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And let me see the stroke before it comes,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That even then when I shall lose my life,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My mind may be more steadfast on my God.<br>

<i>Light.</i> What means your highness to mistrust me thus?<br>

<i>K. Edw.</i> What mean'st thou to dissemble with me thus?<br>

<i>Light.</i> These hands were never stain'd with innocent blood,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor shall they now be tainted with a king's.<br>

<i>K. Edw.</i> Forgive my thought for having such a thought.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One jewel have I left; receive thou this:              [<i>Gives jewel.</i><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Still fear I, and I know not what's the cause,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But every joint shakes as I give it thee.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O, if thou harbour'st murder in thy heart,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let this gift change thy mind, and save thy soul!<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Know that I am a king: O, at that name<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I feel a hell of grief! where is my crown?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gone, gone! and do I [still] remain alive?<br>

<i>Light.</i> You're overwatch'd, my lord: lie down and rest.<br>

<i>K. Edw.</i> But that grief keeps me waking, I should sleep;<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For not these ten days have these eye-lids clos'd.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, as I speak, they fall; and yet with fear<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Open again.  O, wherefore sitt'st thou here?<br>

<i>Light.</i> If you mistrust me, I'll be gone, my lord.<br>

<i>K. Edw.</i> No, no; for, if thou mean'st to murder me,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thou wilt return again; and therefore stay.                 [<i>Sleeps.</i><br>

<i>Light.</i> He sleeps.<br>

<i>K. Edw.</i> [<i>waking</i>] O, let me not die yet!  O, stay a while!<br>

<i>Light.</i> How now, my lord!<br>

<i>K. Edw.</i> Something still buzzeth in mine ears,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And tells me, if I sleep, I never wake:<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This fear is that which makes me tremble thus;<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And therefore tell me, wherefore art thou come?<br>

<i>Light.</i> To rid thee of thy life.—Matrevis, come!<br>
</p>

<p id="id00145">              <i>Enter</i> MATREVIS <i>and</i> GURNEY.</p>

<p id="id00146"><i>K. Edw.</i> I am too weak and feeble to resist.—<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assist me, sweet God, and receive my soul!<br>

<i>Light.</i> Run for the table.<br>

<i>K. Edw.</i> O, spare me, or despatch me in a trice!<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>Matrevis brings in a table.  King Edward is murdered<br>

<i>Light.</i> So, lay the table down, and stamp on it,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But not too hard, lest that you bruise his body.<br>

<i>Mat.</i> I fear me that this cry will raise the town,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And therefore let us take horse and away.<br>

<i>Light.</i> Tell me, sirs, was it not bravely done?<br>

<i>Gur.</i> Excellent well: take this for thy reward.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'll be thy ghostly father; therefore choose,<br>

<i>K. Edw. Third.</i> Villain!—
<i>Y. Mor.</i> Ho, now, my lord!
<i>K. Edw. Third.</i> Think not that I am frighted with thy words:
   My father's murder'd through thy treachery;
   And thou shalt die, and on his mournful hearse
   Thy hateful and accursed head shall lie,
   To witness to the world that by thy means
   His kingly body was too soon interr'd.
<i>Q. Isab.</i> Weep not, sweet son.
<i>K. Edw. Third.</i> Forbid not me to weep; he was my father;
   And had you lov'd him half so well as I,
   You could not bear his death thus patiently:
   But you, I fear, conspir'd with Mortimer.
<i>First Lord.</i> Why speak you not unto my lord the king?
<i>Y. Mor.</i> Because I think scorn to be accus'd.
   Who is the man dares say I murder'd him?
<i>K. Edw. Third.</i> Traitor, in me my loving father speaks,
   And plainly saith, 'twas thou that murder'dst him.
<i>Y. Mor.</i> But hath your grace no other proof than this?
<i>K. Edw. Third.</i> Yes, if this be the hand of Mortimer.
                                                       [<i>Showing letter.</i>

<i>Q. Isab.</i> I fear'd as much: murder can not be hid.
<i>Y. Mor.</i> It is my hand; what gather you by this?
<i>K. Edw. Third.</i> That thither thou didst send a murderer.
<i>Y. Mor.</i> What murderer? bring forth the man I sent.
<i>K. Edw. Third.</i> Ah, Mortimer, thou know'st that he is slain!
   And so shalt thou be too.—Why stays he here?
   Bring him unto a hurdle, drag him forth;
   Hang him, I say, and set his quarters up:
   And bring his head back presently to me.
<i>Q. Isab.</i> For my sake, sweet son, pity Mortimer!
<i>Y. Mor.</i> Madam, entreat not: I will rather die
   Than sue for life unto a paltry boy.
<i>K. Edw. Third.</i> Hence with the traitor, with the murderer!
<i>Y. Mor.</i> Base Fortune, now I see, that in thy wheel
   There is a point, to which when men aspire,
   They tumble headlong down: that point I touch'd,
   And, seeing there was no place to mount up higher,
   Why should I grieve at my declining fall?—
   Farewell, fair queen: weep not for Mortimer,
   That scorns the world, and, as a traveller,
   Goes to discover countries yet unknown.

                              some of the Attendants.</i>

   Spill not the blood of gentle Mortimer!
<i>K. Edw. Third.</i> This argues that you spilt my father's blood,
   Else would you not entreat for Mortimer.
<i>Q. Isab.</i> I spill his blood! no.
<i>K. Edw. Third.</i> Ay, madam, you; for so the rumour runs.
<i>Q. Isab.</i> That rumour is untrue: for loving thee,
   Is this report rais'd on poor Isabel.
<i>K. Edw. Third.</i> I do not think her so unnatural.
<i>Sec. Lord.</i> My lord, I fear me it will prove too true.
<i>K. Edw. Third.</i> Mother, you are suspected for his death
   And therefore we commit you to the Tower,
   Till further trial may be made thereof.
   If you be guilty, though I be your son,
   Think not to find me slack or pitiful.
<i>Q. Isab.</i> Nay, to my death; for too long have I liv'd,
   Whenas my son thinks to abridge my days.
<i>K. Edw. Third.</i> Away with her! her words enforce these tears,
   And I shall pity her, if she speak again.

   And with the rest accompany him to his grave.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg™
</div><div>
Project Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div><div>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™’s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation
</div><div>
Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div><div>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div><div>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div><div>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div><div>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works
</div><div>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div><div>
Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div><div>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div><div>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg™,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
