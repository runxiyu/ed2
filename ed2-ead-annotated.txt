          the Third.                                      sense of the word, a play with no heroes, a drama in which

                            A. Our Story So Far.
        On 25 April 1284, at the castle of Carnarvon in Wales, a son was
    born to the English king, Edward I. According to an apocryphal story,
    the old king proclaimed that his son, also named Edward, was destined
    to be the sovereign of the Welsh.
        It was not until young Edward's older brother Alfonso died in
    August of 1284 that Edward became heir to the throne. During his
    childhood, Edward was presented with a foster brother, a child named
    Pierce (alternately Piers or Peter) Gaveston, the son of a Flemish
    knight who had fought with the king against the Scots. Gaveston
    became Edward's nearest friend and confidant, a relationship which
    eventually blossomed into an uncomfortably close love.
        Edward was trained to be a warrior, but he seems to have preferred
    such rustic pursuits as blacksmithing, raising horses, digging trenches
    and thatching houses. When they were older, Edward and Pierce joined
    the aging king in his later battles with the Scottish, acceptably
    acquitting themselves.
        In 1305, an immature Edward "invaded" the forests owned by the
    Treasurer and Bishop of Coventry, Walter Langton. When Langton
    criticized the prince for his trespass, Edward responded with insults;
    King Edward sided with his Treasurer, and banished his son from the
    court for six months. Young Edward never forgave the prelate;
    Edward's resentment would come back to haunt Langley when the old
    king died, as we will see in Act I of our play.
        The other important event of the junior Edward's life occurred in
    early 1307, when it was reported that he asked his father to give the
    lands of Ponthieu in France as a gift to Gaveston; the old king, enraged,
    and perhaps also worried about the too-near relationship between
    Gaveston and his son, banished his son's best friend from England on
    February 26.
        Just five months later, King Edward died, and young Edward
    ascended the throne. His first order of business was to recall his
    companion Gaveston.

                       B. Basic Timeline of the Play.
       Edward II can be basically divided into two halves:

       Part One: Act I.i - Act III.i; the Gaveston years (1307-1312).
       Transitional Scene: Act III.ii; the scene ties together Gaveston's
    removal in 1312 to Edward's military challenge to Lancaster at
    Boroughbridge in 1322.
       Part Two: Act III.iii - Act V.v; the final years of Edward's reign
    (1322-1327).
       Coda: Act V.vi, the final scene of the play; the end of the Mortimer
    era (1330).

            C. Scene Breaks, Settings, and Stage Directions.
       Edward II was originally published in 1594; later editions, which
    included modest revisions, followed in 1598, 1612 and 1622. As usual,
    we lean towards adhering to the wording of the earliest quarto as much
    as possible. Words or syllables which have been added to the text to
    clarify the sense or repair the meter are identified by being surrounded
    by hard brackets [ ]; as such, they may be omitted by a director who
    wishes to remain truer to the original text.
        The quartos do not divide Edward II into numbered scenes, nor do
    they provide scene settings or identify asides. We have broken up the
    play into Acts and Scenes as suggested Ellis. We adopt the scene
    settings suggested by Dyce and Ellis, and the asides by Dyce.
        Finally, as is our normal practice, a good number of the quarto's
    stage directions have been modified, and others added, usually without
    comment, to give clarity to the action. Most of these changes are
    adopted from Dyce.

                         D. Annotations in Italics.
       Those annotations which appear in italics serve two distinct
    functions: they provide either:
       (1) biographical background on the characters, or
       (2) historical context for the events of the play,
           allowing the reader:
           (a) to see when in real time the events depicted
               in Edward II occurred, and
           (b) to know where Marlowe has deviated from
               historical reality, either by changing the
               timeline of events, or inventing action or
               characters out of thin air.
       The most important thing to note is that it is not necessary to read
    the italicized annotations in order to understand the play.

    2    And share the kingdom with thy dearest friend.”              friend, the new king Edward.
         Ah! words that make me surfeit with delight!              = "fill me".
    4    What greater bliss can hap to Gaveston                    = happen.
         Than live and be the favourite of a king!
    6    Sweet prince, I come; these, these thy amorous lines
         Might have enforced me to have swum from France,          = compelled.

    10   The sight of London to my exiled eyes

    12   Not that I love the city, or the men,
         But that it harbours him I hold so dear −
    14   The king, upon whose bosom let me die,                    = "swoon", but die was also used frequently to refer to

    20   As for the multitude, that are but sparks,                  20-21: Gaveston compares the masses of common people

          Thou should’st not plod one foot beyond this place.             religious office is the only thing protecting his life.

          As then I did incense the parliament,                        249-250: As then…I now = "then I will do as I did back

    278   Bish. of Cov. True, true.                                      278: the exact meaning of this line has been lost to history,

          And take possession of his house and goods.
    282   Come, follow me, and thou shalt have my guard

          Gav. What should a priest do with so fair a house?             285-6: Gaveston mocks the great wealth of the Bishop.
    286   A prison may beseem his holiness.                              286: a prison is a more fitting abode for the ascetic lifestyle

    74    Y. Mort. Madam, whither walks your majesty so fast?            = to where.

    76    Q. Isab. Unto the forest, gentle Mortimer,                     = a metaphor for "away from the world". 9
          To live in grief and baleful discontent;                       = deadly, malignant.1
    78    For now my lord the king regards me not,
          But dotes upon the love of Gaveston.
    80    He claps his cheeks, and hangs about his neck,                 = pats.
          Smiles in his face, and whispers in his ears;
    82    And when I come, he frowns, as who should say,                 = "as if to say".
          "Go whither thou wilt, seeing I have Gaveston."                = "to wherever you wish".
    84
          E. Mort. Is it not strange that he is thus bewitched?
    86
          Y. Mort. Madam, return unto the court again:
    88    That sly inveigling Frenchman we'll exíle,
          Or lose our lives; and yet, ere that day come,
    90    The king shall lose his crown; for we have power,
          And courage too, to be revenged at full.
    92
          A. of Cant. But yet lift not your swords against the king.
    94
          Lanc. No; but we will lift Gaveston from hence.                = ie. steal.14

          Q. Isab. Then let him stay; for rather than my lord
    100   Shall be oppressed by civil mutinies,                          = tumults.7
          I will endure a melancholy life,
    102   And let him frolic with his miniön.

          We and the rest, that are his counsellors,
    106   Will meet, and with a general consent

    172   Gav. My Lord, I hear it whispered everywhere,
          That I am banished and must fly the land.
    174
          K. Edw. 'Tis true, sweet Gaveston – O! were it false!        = ie. "if only it were".
    176   The legate of the Pope will have it so,
          And thou must hence, or I shall be deposed.                  = ie. "must go from here".
    178   But I will reign to be revenged of them;                     = on.
          And therefore, sweet friend, take it patiently.

    182   I'll come to thee; my love shall ne'er decline.              = literally, "turn away from your direction."

    184   Gav. Is all my hope turned to this hell of grief?
    186   K. Edw. Rend not my heart with thy too-piercing words:

          Gav. To go from hence grieves not poor Gaveston;
    190   But to forsake you, in whose gracious looks
          The blessedness of Gaveston remains:
    192   For nowhere else seeks he felicity.                          = happiness.

    194   K. Edw. And only this torments my wretched soul,
          That, whether I will or no, thou must depart.                = common elliptical phrase (ie. one with omitted words),

    202   O, might I keep thee here as I do this,
          Happy were I! but now most miserable!                        = "would I be".
    204
          Gav. 'Tis something to be pitied of a king.                  = by.
    206
          K. Edw. Thou shalt not hence − I'll hide thee, Gaveston.     = go.
    208
          Gav. I shall be found, and then 'twill grieve me more.
    210
          K. Edw. Kind words and mutual talk makes our grief
             greater:
    212   Therefore, with dumb embracement, let us part −              = silent.
          Stay, Gaveston, I cannot leave thee thus.                    = "don't go yet".
    214
          Gav. For every look, my lord drops down a tear:              = the quartos print lord, but many editors emend it to love.
    216   Seeing I must go, do not renew my sorrow.
    218   K. Edw. The time is little that thou hast to stay,           218: Gaveston was actually given until 25 June - a full
          And, therefore, give me leave to look my fill:                  month - to leave England.
    220   But, come, sweet friend, I'll bear thee on thy way.
    222   Gav. The peers will frown.
    224   K. Edw. I pass not for their anger − Come, let's go;         = care.
          O that we might as well return as go!
    226
                                             Enter Queen Isabella. 227: the quartos have Kent entering with the queen, but

    236   I say no more − judge you the rest, my lord.
    238   Q. Isab. In saying this, thou wrong'st me, Gaveston:
          Is't not enough that thou corrupt'st my lord,
    240   And art a bawd to his affectiöns,                          240: a bawd = ie. one who ministers to the king's lust.
          But thou must call mine honour thus in question?              affections = inclinations.
    242
          Gav. I mean not so; your grace must pardon me.
    244
          K. Edw. Thou art too familiar with that Mortimer,
    246   And by thy means is Gaveston exiled;                       246: as a matter of history, Isabella was only in her mid-
          But I would wish thee reconcile the lords,                    teens during the Gaveston years, and played no role in

    250   Q. Isab. Your highness knows it lies not in my power.
    252   K. Edw. Away, then! touch me not − Come, Gaveston.
    254   Q. Isab. Villain! 'tis thou that robb'st me of my lord.
    256   Gav. Madam, 'tis you that rob me of my lord.               256: ie. by (allegedly) being the cause of his exile.

    258   K. Edw. Speak not unto her; let her droop and pine.        = languish, be dejected. = waste away with suffering. 1

    260   Q. Isab. Wherein, my lord, have I deserved these words?    260: "what have I done to deserve these words from you?"
          Witness the tears that Isabella sheds,
    262   Witness this heart, that sighing for thee, breaks,
          How dear my lord is to poor Isabel!
    264
          K. Edw. And witness Heaven how dear thou art to me:        265: Edward is cruelly sarcastic: he may even put an arm
                                                                        around Gaveston as he speaks this line.

    266   There weep: for till my Gaveston be repealed,              266: Gaveston = occasionally, as here, a disyllable: perhaps
          Assure thyself thou com'st not in my sight.                   pronounced as Gav's-ton.

          Like frantic Juno will I fill the earth                     279-282: Isabella compares herself to Juno, the queen of

          For never doted Jove on Ganymede                            sought affection in the arms of others, usually to her great
    282   So much as he on cursèd Gaveston:                           anger or dismay; Ganymede was a Trojan prince whom Jove

          But that will more exasperate his wrath;
    284   I must entreat him, I must speak him fair,
          And be a means to call home Gaveston:
    286   And yet he'll ever dote on Gaveston;
          And so am I for ever miserable.
    288
                         Re-enter Lancaster, Warwick, Pembroke,
    290                  the Elder Mortimer and Young Mortimer.
    292   Lanc. Look where the sister of the king of France
          Sits wringing of her hands, and beats her breast!
    294
          War. The king, I fear, hath ill-entreated her.              = ie. ill-treated.
    296
          Pemb. Hard is the heart that injures such a saint.
    298
          Y. Mort. I know 'tis ‘long of Gaveston she weeps.           = on account of.2
    300
          E. Mort. Why? he is gone.
    302
          Y. Mort.             Madam, how fares your grace?
    304
          Q. Isab. Ah, Mortimer! now breaks the king's hate forth,
    306   And he confesseth that he loves me not.
    308   Y. Mort. Cry quittance, madam, then, and love not him.      = "get even with him", or "give him the same treatment".

    310   Q. Isab. No, rather will I die a thousand deaths:
          And yet I love in vain; − he'll ne'er love me.
    312
          Lanc. Fear ye not, madam; now his minion's gone,
    314   His wanton humour will be quickly left.                     = capricious or self-indulgent frame of mind.1,2

    316   Q. Isab. O, never, Lancaster! I am enjoined                 = "being forced".
          To sue unto you all for his repeal:                         = beg or entreat. = recall.
    318   This wills my lord, and this must I perform,                = "this is what the king commands".
          Or else be banished from his highness' presence.
    320
          Lanc. For his repeal, madam! he comes not back,
    322   Unless the sea cast up his shipwrack[ed] body.
    324   War. And to behold so sweet a sight as that,
          There's none here but would run his horse to death.         = ie. "who would not".
    326
          Y. Mort. But, madam, would you have us call him home?
    328
          Q. Isab. Ay, Mortimer, for till he be restored,
    330   The angry king hath banished me the court;                  = from the.

                                                                27�

          And, therefore, as thou lov'st and tender'st me,              = cares for or esteems; while Mortimer and Isabella may
    332   Be thou my advocate unto these peers.                            not be carrying on an affair as yet, the line is suggestive
                                                                           of a connection between them.
    334   Y. Mort. What! would you have me plead for Gaveston?
    336   E. Mort. Plead for him he that will, I am resolved.           336: "I don't care if anyone else pleads with me to recall
                                                                           Gaveston, my mind is firmly made up against it."
    338   Lanc. And so am I, my lord: dissuade the queen.
    340   Q. Isab. O, Lancaster! let him dissuade the king,
          For 'tis against my will he should return.
    342
          War. Then speak not for him, let the peasant go.
    344
          Q. Isab. 'Tis for myself I speak, and not for him.
    346
          Pemb. No speaking will prevail; and therefore cease.          = ie. avail.8
    348
          Y. Mort. Fair queen, forbear to angle for the fish            = fish.
    350   Which, being caught, strikes him that takes it dead;          = "kills him who catches it."
          I mean that vile torpedo, Gaveston,                           = torpedo is an ancient name for the electric ray; it was

                                                                           anyone who touched it with a rod or stick.

    352   That now, I hope, floats on the Irish seas.                   352: ie. who is now on a ship heading to Ireland.

    354   Q. Isab. Sweet Mortimer, sit down by me a while,
          And I will tell thee reasons of such weight                   = gravity.
    356   As thou wilt soon subscribe to his repeal.
    358   Y. Mort. It is impossible; but speak your mind.
    360   Q. Isab. Then thus; but none shall hear it but ourselves.
    362                            [Talks to Young Mortimer apart.]
    364   Lanc. My lords, albeit the queen win Mortimer,                364: "even if Isabella can convince Mortimer to take her
          Will you be resolute, and hold with me?                          side".
    366
          E. Mort. Not I, against my nephew.
    368
          Pemb. Fear not; the queen's words cannot alter him.
    370
          War. No? Do but mark how earnestly she pleads!                = observe.
    372
          Lanc. And see how coldly his looks make denial!
    374
          War. She smiles; now, for my life, his mind is changed!       = an oath.
    376
          Lanc. I'll rather lose his friendship, I, than grant.         = consent.1
    378
          Y. Mort. Well, of necessity it must be so. −
    380   My lords, that I abhor base Gaveston,
          I hope your honours make no questiön,
    382   And therefore, though I plead for his repeal,
          'Tis not for his sake, but for our avail;                     = advantage.
    384   Nay, for the realm's behoof, and for the king's.              = benefit.

          Can this be true, 'twas good to banish him?
    388   And is this true, to call him home again?
          Such reasons make white black, and dark night day.
    390
          Y. Mort. My lord of Lancaster, mark the respect.          = "consider the special circumstances".1,3
    392
          Lanc. In no respect can contraries be true.               393: ie. it cannot be beneficial to both banish and recall
                                                                       Gaveston.

          War. All that he speaks is nothing; we are resolved.
    398
          Y. Mort. Do you not wish that Gaveston were dead?

          Pemb. I would he were!                                    = wish.

          Y. Mort. Why then, my lord, give me but leave to speak.   = permission.
    404
          E. Mort. But, nephew, do not play the sophister.          = one who makes superficially convincing, but actually

    408   To mend the king and do our country good.                 = put right.
          Know you not Gaveston hath store of gold,                 = an abundance.
    410   Which may in Ireland purchase him such friends
          As he will front the mightiest of us all?                 = confront; Mortimer suggests Gaveston has enough

          'Tis hard for us to work his overthrow.

          Y. Mort. But were he here, detested as he is,
    418   How easily might some base slave be suborned              = bribed or persuaded.
          To greet his lordship with a poniard,                     = dagger.

    420   And none so much as blame the murtherer,                  = ie. murderer; murder is sometimes spelled murther
                                                                       in the quarto, but not consistently (the same goes for

    428
          Y. Mort. Because, my lords, it was not thought upon.
    430   Nay, more, when he shall know it lies in us
          To banish him, and then to call him home,               431-2: Mortimer suggests that the combined act of banishing
    432   'Twill make him vail the top-flag of his pride,         and then recalling Gaveston will humble him enough to

    440   So shall we have the people of our side,                440-2: the people, in their present mood, are, out of love

    1    Bald. Spenser,                                              1-3: As the scene opens, we learn that the Earl of Gloucester
    2    Seeing that our lord the Earl of Gloucester's dead,            has died, and Spenser and Baldock must decide to
         Which of the nobles dost thou mean to serve?                   whom they should turn their loyalties.
                                                                          The real Gloucester did not die until the post-

    4
         Spen. Not Mortimer, nor any of his side,                    = faction.
    6    Because the king and he are enemies.
         Baldock, learn this of me: a factious lord                  = rebellious.2
    8    Shall hardly do himself good, much less us;
         But he that hath the favour of a king,
    10   May with one word advance us while we live:                 = ie. "promote us" or "raise us in status".
         The liberal Earl of Cornwall is the man                     = generous.
    12   On whose good fortune Spenser's hope depends.               11-12: out of pure self-interest, Spenser suggests he will
                                                                        seek to join the king's party by becoming a retainer of

    14   Bald. What, mean you then to be his follower?               = a feudal notion, in which one gains protection and
                                                                        patronage from another of superior status in return

    16   Y. Spen. No, his companion; for he loves me well,
         And would have once preferred me to the king.               = recommended; the line suggests Spenser was once a close
    18                                                                  friend of Gaveston's.
         Bald. But he is banished; there's small hope of him.
    20
         Y. Spen. Ay, for a while; but, Baldock, mark the end.       = ie. "just see what will happen"
    22   A friend of mine told me in secrecy
         That he's repealed and sent for back again;                 = recalled; it seems unlikely, given the joyous reconciliation
                                                                        between the barons and the king at the end of the last

    24   And even now a post came from the court
         With letters to our lady from the king;                   = our lady is Margaret de Clare, Gloucester's sister; she
    26   And as she read she smiled, which makes me think             had been pegged to become Gaveston's wife ever since
         It is about her lover Gaveston.                              her uncle, our King Edward II, ascended the throne.
    28
         Bald. 'Tis like enough; for, since he was exíled,
    30   She neither walks abroad, nor comes in sight.             30: she never goes out, instead remaining hidden and alone.
         But I had thought the match had been broke off,
    32   And that his banishment had changed her mind.
    34   Y. Spen. Our lady's first love is not wavering;
         My life for thine, she will have Gaveston.                = "I'll bet my life against yours".
    36
         Bald. Then hope I by her means to be preferred,           = advanced or promoted in rank.

    38   Having read unto her since she was a child.               38: Baldock has attended university, which would have

    40   Y. Spen. Then, Baldock, you must cast the scholar off,    40f: in this speech, Spenser teases the educated Baldock for

    68   K. Edw. My Gaveston!
         Welcome to Tynemouth! Welcome to thy friend!             = friend was an ambiguous word, as it was frequently used
                                                                  to mean "lover", in addition to its normal sense.
                                                                     It appears the entire court has travelled to the north of

    70   Thy absence made me droop and pine away;                 = "languish" and "waste away with suffering". Marlowe was
                                                                       partial to using the two verbs together.

         For, as the lovers of fair Danaë,                        71-72: a reference to the popular myth of Danae: Acrisius,

                                                                  his daughter Danae would grow up to kill him. To prevent

                                                                  (brazen) tower or underground apartment. Zeus visited her
                                                                  in the form of a shower of gold, which impregnated her,
                                                                  resulting in the birth of the Greek hero Perseus.

         Desired her more, and waxed outrageöus,                  = grew wild or unrestrained.2 There is no mythological basis
                                                                     for suggesting that Danae had any lovers, waxing out-

         Is sweeter far than was thy parting hence
    76   Bitter and irksome to my sobbing heart.

         Or that these tears, that drizzle from mine eyes,
    38   Had power to mollify his stony heart,
         That, when I had him, we might never part.                   38-39: a rhyming couplet.

    46   Y. Mort.                     Who's this? The queen!

    54   He turns away, and smiles upon his miniön.
    56   Y. Mort. Cease to lament, and tell us where's the king?
    58   Q. Isab. What would you with the king? Is't him you seek?    = ie. "do you want with".

    60   Lanc. No, madam, but that cursèd Gaveston.
         Far be it from the thought of Lancaster
    62   To offer violence to his sovereign!
         We would but rid the realm of Gaveston:
    64   Tell us where he remains, and he shall die.
    66   Q. Isab. He's gone by water unto Scarborough;
         Pursue him quickly, and he cannot 'scape;

    74    Q. Isab. That this your army, going several ways,             = separate.
          Might be of lesser force, and with the power                  = army.
    76    That he intendeth presently to raise,

    82    Lanc. The wind that bears him hence will fill our sails:      = from here.

    92    As if he hear I have but talked with you,
          Mine honour will be called in questiön;
    94    And therefore, gentle Mortimer, be gone.
    96    Y. Mort. Madam, I cannot stay to answer you,
          But think of Mortimer as he deserves.                         97: Mortimer speaks of himself in the third person.

          In vain I look for love at Edward's hand,
    104   Whose eyes are fixed on none but Gaveston.

         Ah! Spenser, not the riches of my realm

    26   K. Edw. Yea, gentle Spenser, we have been too mild,
         Too kind to them; but now have drawn our sword,

              Bannockburn and the Lancaster Years (1314-1317).
          The devastating loss to the outnumbered Scottish at
          Bannockburn (23-24 June 1314) signaled an opportunity for
          the barons to reassert their preeminence in governing
          England. Several of Edward's favourites, including the Elder
          Despenser, were removed from the court, and Lancaster was
          appointed both chief of the ruling Council and commander-
          in-chief of the armies facing the Scots. Edward was forced to
          reconfirm the Ordinances (see the note at line 34 earlier in
          Act III.ii), and was even placed on an allowance of 10£ per
          day.
             Rise of the Middle Party (1317-1320). At this time a
          large faction formed, centered around Pembroke, Arundel,
          the Elder Despenser, the Mortimers, and Bishop Langton.
          This Middle Party acted as a counterweight to Lancaster,
          who had a habit of raising his own armies and refusing to
          attend parliaments. On the other hand, though generally
          supportive of Edward, the Middle Party forced Edward to
          reconfirm the Ordinances, and caused the removal of his
          most hated advisors.
              Beginning of the Despenser Years (1320). Despite his
          portrayal in our play, the Younger Despenser had until 1320
          been a member of the barons' party; it was they who had
          appointed Despenser the king's Chamberlain in 1313. By
          1320, though, Young Despenser had become Edward's new
          favourite, and the Younger and Elder Despensers together
          became the de facto rulers of the kingdom. Insatiably
          greedy, the Despensers used their positions as a means to
          accumulate property and wealth, which, like Gaveston had
          done years earlier, they parked much of in safekeeping
          outside of England. The pair became feared because of their
          power and hated because of their rapaciousness.
              The Marcher Wars (1321). A land dispute led to a war
          between the marcher lords and the Younger Despenser; civil
          strife raged through much of Wales and western England.
          The Middle Party broke up, as most of its members, in
          hatred of the Despensers, joined the marcher lords, while
          Edward naturally supported Despenser (Pembroke and
          Arundel notably remained with the king). The barons' army
          ravaged the Despensers' home territory of Glamorgan in
          south Wales, then marched on London, and forced Edward
          to submit once again to their demands, which included
          exiling the Despensers in August 1321. The Elder
          Despenser, cooperative, went to the Continent, but the
          Younger Despenser became a dangerous pirate on the
          English Channel!
              Reemergence of Edward (October 1321). In this month
          a strange event occurred, in which Isabella, traveling to
          Canterbury, was not permitted to enter her own castle at
          Leeds to spend the night. The castle was occupied by the
          wife of Baron Badlesmere, an enemy of the king, and Lady
          Badlesmere had even fired on the royal party when Isabella
          ordered her guards to attack the castle. This slap in the face
          of royal authority was just what the doctor ordered, and
          Edward, reasserting his authority, raised an army which
          quickly grew to 30,000 strong. After capturing Leeds Castle,
          he marched west, and, in the most impressive episode of his
          life, chased the marcher lords up the Severn Valley.
              With Edward in the ascendant, the Despensers were
          called back from their brief exiles.

                                                                       reached the village of Boroughbridge, only to find his way
                                                                       across the bridge blocked by a small loyalist army led by Sir
                                                                       Andrew Harclay. With elements of Edward's army on his

                                                                          This is where we are now in our play. In a very slick bit

    1    K. Edw. Now, lusty lords, now not by chance of war,          = insolent.1 = luck.
    2    But justice of the quarrel and the cause,
         Vailed is your pride; methinks you hang the heads,           = lowered, ie. humbled.4 = ie. your.
    4    But we'll advance them, traitors: now 'tis time              = promote their heads - by cutting them off and raising

         To be avenged on you for all your braves,                    = insults.9
    6    And for the murther of my dearest friend,
         To whom right well you knew our soul was knit,
    8    Good Pierce of Gaveston, my sweet favourite.
         Ah, rebels! Recreants! you made him away!                    = traitors. = ie. killed him.

    18   Accursèd wretches, was't in regard of us,                    = the king scornfully repeats Kent's phrase of line 11.
         When we had sent our messenger to request                    = a disyllable again: MESS'N-ger.
    20   He might be spared to come to speak with us,
         And Pembroke undertook for his return,                       = ie. took responsibility.
    22   That thou, proud Warwick, watched the prisoner,              = ie. guarded Gaveston, an ironic comment.
         Poor Pierce, and headed him ‘gainst law of arms?             = ie. beheaded. = against the established, if unofficial, rules

         War. Tyrant, I scorn thy threats and menaces;
    28   It is but temporal that thou canst inflict.                  = worldly (punishment); Warwick's point is that Edward

    30   Lanc. The worst is death; and better die to live             = ie. in Heaven.

    44
         K. Edw. Go, take that haughty Mortimer to the Tower,        45: The Mortimers were not at the Battle of Boroughbridge;

    52   No, Edward, England's scourge, it may not be;

                                                         a sizable household of her own, and plenty of income to do
                                                         with as she wished.

                                                         isolated from others' influence as much as possible,
                                                         convinced Edward in 1324 of the need to sequester the
                                                         queen's lands, on the theory that she might be furtively

                                                         housekeeper, where she was officially charged with
                                                         reviewing all of Isabella's correspondence. Deprived of her
                                                         land and servants, and reduced to an allowance of 20

                                                         blunder committed by the Despensers was allowing Isabella
                                                         to leave England and travel to France in March 1325,

                                                         Charles IV - Isabella decided to stay in Paris, refusing to
                                                         return to an England run by the Spensers.

                                                            Eventually Isabella was joined by Young Mortimer, the

          How say, young prince? what think you of the match?          = contest, game.1

          Pr. Edw. I think king Edward will outrun us all.             = ie. "come out on top"; with outrun, the prince glances

    24   Why, so; they barked apace a month ago:                      = ie. embarked (on their enterprise). = swifly. 1
         Now, on my life, they'll neither bark nor bite.              25: Edward puns on barked.
    26   Now, sirs, the news from France? Gloucester, I trow          = "am confident".
         The lords of France love England's gold so well
    28   As Isabell[a] gets no aid from thence.
         What now remains? Have you proclaimed, my lord,
    30   Reward for them can bring in Mortimer?
    32   Y. Spen. My lord, we have; and if he be in England,

         K. Edw. If, dost thou say? Spenser, as true as death,        = ie. "if he is in England, you say?"

    1    Leic. Be patient, good my lord, cease to lament;
    2    Imagine Killingworth castle were your court,               = ie. is.
         And that you lay for pleasure here a space,                = stay, remain. = for a while.
    4    Not of compulsion or necessity.
    6    K. Edw. Leicester, if gentle words might comfort me,
         Thy speeches long ago had eased my sorrows;                = would have.
    8    For kind and loving hast thou always been.
         The griefs of private men are soon allayed,
    10   But not of kings. The forest deer, being struck,           10: not = ie. "not those".
         Runs to an herb that closeth up the wounds;                   10-11: The forest deer…wounds = deer were believed to

    12   But when th’ imperial lion's flesh is gored,
         He rends and tears it with his wrathful paw,               = another pleonasm.
    14   [And] highly scorning that the lowly earth

         Should drink his blood, mounts up into the air.             = rears up, so that his front paws are in the air.
    16   And so it fares with me, whose dauntless mind
         Th’ ambitious Mortimer would seek to curb,
    18   And that unnatural queen, false Isabel,                     = ie. because she would harm her husband; unnatural is

         That thus hath pent and mewed me in a prison;               = another pleonasm, as both pent and mewed mean
                                                                        "shut up".

    20   For such outrageous passions cloy my soul,                  = emotions. = fill, satiate.
         As with the wings of rancour and disdain                    = that.
    22   Full often am I soaring up to Heaven,
         To plain me to the gods against them both.                  = complain;1 the extra me is an intensifier, another example
    24   But when I call to mind I am a king,                           of the ethical dative. Edward uses the construction again
         Methinks I should revenge me of my wrongs,                     in line 25.
    26   That Mortimer and Isabel have done.
         But what are kings, when regiment is gone,                  = royal authority.
    28   But perfect shadows in a sunshine day?                      = ie. nothing more than mere shadows.
                                                                        perfect = utter or pure.1
         My nobles rule; I bear the name of king;
    30   I wear the crown, but am controlled by them,
         By Mortimer, and my unconstant queen,                       = unfaithful, disloyal.
    32   Who spots my nuptial bed with infamy;                       = stains; Edward alludes to Isabella's now-open adultery
                                                                        with Mortimer.

         Whilst I am lodged within this cave of care,                = ie. prison; care = anxiety; the phrase cave of care is
                                                                        pleasantly and simultaneously alliterative and assonant.

    34   Where sorrow at my elbow still attends,                     = "waits on me".
         To company my heart with sad laments,                       = ie. accompany.
    36   That bleeds within me for this strange exchange. −          = transformation.2
         But tell me, must I now resign my crown,
    38   To make usurping Mortimer a king?
    40   B. of Win. Your grace mistakes; it is for England's good,   40-41: Edward is wrong: it is his son, not Mortimer, who
         And princely Edward's right we crave the crown.                will assume the throne.
    42
         K. Edw. No, 'tis for Mortimer, not Edward's head;
    44   For he's a lamb, encompassèd by wolves,                     = ie. "the prince is". = surrounded.
         Which in a moment will abridge his life.                    = ie. at any. = shorten, ie. take.

    46   But if proud Mortimer do wear this crown,                   46-47: an allusion to the ancient Greek dramatist Euripides'

                                                                     husband Jason's marriage to the daughter of the king of
                                                                     Corinth, gives the unsuspecting princess a gift of a crown

    48   Or like the snaky wreath of Tisiphon,                       48-49: Tisiphone was one of the avenging female spirits
         Engirt the temples of his hateful head;                     known as the Furies. The ladies were imagined to be dressed

         Leic. My lord, why waste you thus the time away?

    188   K. Edw. [Taking the paper]
          By Mortimer, whose name is written here!
    190   Well may I rent his name that rends my heart!                 = tear up.

    194   This poor revenge hath something eased my mind.
          So may his limbs be torn, as is this paper!
    196   Hear me, immortal Jove, and grant it too!                     = Jove was often used, as here, to mean God.8 = ie. this.

          Berk. Even so betide my soul as I use him.                    205: "may my soul be rewarded or punished based on how

    210   Berk. And thinks your grace that Berkeley will be cruel?
    212   K. Edw. I know not; but of this am I assured,

          ACT V, SCENE II.
          An apartment in the royal palace.

                       Enter Queen Isabella and Young Mortimer.
     1    Y. Mort. Fair Isabel, now have we our desire;

          Have done their homage to the lofty gallows,                = the Chronicles state that the Elder Spenser was hanged
                                                                         on a "paire of gallowes of fiftie feet in heigth" (Tancock,

         Be ruled by me, and we will rule the realm.                = common formula for "follow my guidance".
    6    In any case, take heed of childish fear,
         For now we hold an old wolf by the ears,                   = earlier editors suggest the wolf in this common proverb

         And gripe the sorer, being griped himself.                 = "seize us most viciously".

    10   Think therefore, madam, that imports as much               = "that suggests or signifies"; but as is usually emended to
                                                                       us, so the meaning of the clause changes to "that it is

    12   And that I be protector over him;

    32   Q. Isab. How fares my lord the king?

         B. of Win. Further, ere this letter was sealed, Lord
            Berkeley came,
    50   So that he now is gone from Killingworth;                     = Edward.
         And we have heard that Edmund laid a plot                     51-52: rumour has it that Kent, his change of heart complete,
    52   To set his brother free; no more but so.                         is plotting to free his brother Edward.

         The lord of Berkeley is so pitiful                            53: so = as; so is usually emended to as.
    54   As Leicester that had charge of him before.                        pitiful = ie. full of pity for the king, so that the king's

          ACT V, SCENE III.
          Before Kenilworth (Killingworth) Castle.

                         Enter Matrevis and Gurney and Soldiers,
                                             with King Edward.
     1    Mat. My lord, be not pensive, we are your friends;
     2    Men are ordained to live in misery,                         2: Matrevis justifies Edward's treatment with some pop-
                                                                         psychology.
          Therefore, come, − dalliance dangereth our lives.           = idle delay.9 = endangers; a rare 16th century use of
     4                                                                   danger as a verb.1
          K. Edw. Friends, whither must unhappy Edward go?
     6    Will hateful Mortimer appoint no rest?                      = ie. grant.
          Must I be vexèd like the nightly bird,                      = tormented. = ie. the owl.
     8    Whose sight is loathsome to all wingèd fowls?
          When will the fury of his mind assuage?                     = abate, diminish.


                                                               104�

    10   When will his heart be satisfied with blood?
         If mine will serve, unbowel straight this breast,           = right now.
    12   And give my heart to Isabel and him;
         It is the chiefest mark they level at.                      13: an archery metaphor: it is the main target (mark) they

    14
         Gurn. Not so, my liege. The queen hath given this charge    = given, like most two-syllable words with a medial v,
                                                                        is normally pronounced in a single syllable, with the

    16   To keep your grace in safety;
         Your passions make your dolours to increase.                = emoting. = grief.2
    18
         K. Edw. This usage makes my misery increase.                = treatment.
    20   But can my air of life continue long                        = ie. breath.
         When all my senses are annoyed with stench?                 = distressed.7
    22   Within a dungeon England's king is kept,
         Where I am starved for want of sustenance.                  = ie. dying.
    24   My daily diet is heartbreaking sobs,
         That almost rents the closet of my heart;                   = tears apart. = the chamber or sac within which the heart

    26   Thus lives old Edward not relieved by any,
         And so must die, though pitièd by many.                     26-27: note the rhyming couplet.
    28   O, water, gentle friends, to cool my thirst
         And clear my body from foul excrements!                     = likely meaning "filth" generally.7
    30
         Mat. Here's channel water, as our charge is given;          = gutter. = "we were instructed to do."
    32   Sit down, for we'll be barbers to your grace.               32: ie. they will shave Edward's beard.

    34   K. Edw. Traitors, away! What, will you murther me,
         Or choke your sovereign with puddle water?
    36
         Gurn. No, but wash your face, and shave away your
            beard,
    38   Lest you be known, and so be rescuèd.                       37-38: Edward's keepers moved the king secretly from castle
                                                                     to castle, so as to prevent those who might be planning to

                                                                     his beard and hair so as to make it more difficult for anyone

    40   Mat. Why strive you thus? Your labour is in vain!           = "why do you bother to fight us?"

    42   K. Edw. The wren may strive against the lion's strength,    42: ie. even if it is futile to do so.
         But all in vain: so vainly do I strive
    44   To seek for mercy at a tyrant's hand.

    50   That wait upon my poor distressèd soul,                     = attend.
         O level all your looks upon these daring men,               = aim.
    52   That wrong their liege and sovereign, England's king!
         O Gaveston, ‘tis for thee that I am wronged,
    54   For me, both thou and both the Spensers died!
         And for your sakes a thousand wrongs I'll take.             = "I'll suffer a thousand insults."
    56   The Spensers' ghosts, wherever they remain,                 = reside.

    60    Come, come, away; now put the torches out.                    60-61: with the torches extinguished, the ensuing scene
          We'll enter in by darkness to Killingworth.                      with Kent is understood to occur in complete darkness. 14

                                                         Enter Kent.
    64
          Gurn. How now, who comes there?
    66
          Mat. Guard the king sure: it is the Earl of Kent.
    68
          K. Edw. O gentle brother, help to rescue me!
    70
          Mat. Keep them asunder; thrust in the king.                   = apart. = ie. back into the castle.
    72
          Kent. Soldiers, let me but talk to him one word.
    74
          Gurn. Lay hands upon the earl for this assault.
    76
          Kent. Lay down your weapons, traitors! yield the king!
    78
          Mat. Edmund, yield thou thyself, or thou shalt die.
    80
          Kent. Base villains, wherefore do you gripe me thus?          = seize.
    82
          Gurn. Bind him, and so convey him to the court.               = ie. to Mortimer and Isabella.
    84
          Kent. Where is the court but here? here is the king;
    86    And I will visit him; why stay you me?
    88    Mat. The court is where lord Mortimer remains;                = resides.
          Thither shall your honour go; and so farewell.                = to there.

          Kent. O, miserable is that commonweal,                        = nation.2

    96    Sold. Wherefore stay we? on, sirs, to the court!              = "why (wherefore) do we delay?"

          ACT V, SCENE IV.
          An apartment in the royal palace.

                                                                106�

                                    Enter Young Mortimer, alone.
    1    Y. Mort. The king must die, or Mortimer goes down;
    2    The commons now begin to pity him:
         Yet he that is the cause of Edward's death                 3-4: Mortimer worries that when the prince grows up, he
    4    Is sure to pay for it when his son is of age;              will certainly be obliged to get revenge on the man -
                                                                    whoever it is - who kills the king.
                                                                       Line 4 is another example of an alexandrine, a line with

         And therefore will I do it cunningly.
    6    This letter, written by a friend of ours,                  = the Baker chronicle says the king's great enemy, Adam
         Contains his death, yet bids them save his life.              Orleton, the Bishop of Hereford, came up with the idea
                                                                       of the ambiguous letter described here (Hutchison, p.
                                                                       142).5
    8    [Reads]
         “Edwardum occidere nolite timere, bonum est":
    10   Fear not to kill the king, 'tis good he die.
         But read it thus, and that's another sense:                = ie. "if you read it with different punctuation".
    12   Edwardum occidere nolite, timere bonum est":
         Kill not the king, 'tis good to fear the worst.
    14   Unpointed as it is, thus shall it go,                      6-14: the letter of instruction, written in Latin, is
                                                                    unpunctuated (unpointed), and could, depending on how one

                                                                    king, or to not; Mortimer expects the jailers to infer the
                                                                    former.

                                                                    but definitely one too good for Marlowe to omit!

         That, being dead, if it chance to be found,                = ie. once Edward is dead. = ie. the letter.
    16   Matrevis and the rest may bear the blame,
         And we be quit that caused it to be done.                  17: we = I

                                                                       15-17: Mortimer believes he will be immune from blame
                                                                    for ordering the king's death, because (1) the letter will not

    20   And by a secret token that he bears,                       20: the messenger will deliver a token - some object, such

    22   Lightborn, come forth!                                        and its severe instructions are indeed from Mortimer.

    24                                            Enter Lightborn. 24: Entering Character: the messenger Lightborn is

    26   Art thou so resolute as thou wast?
    28   Light. What else, my lord? and far more resolute.
    30   Y. Mort. And hast thou cast how to accomplish it?          = contrived, figured out.

    32   Light. Ay, ay, and none shall know which way he died.      32: "yes, yes, and nobody shall know how he died", ie.

    34   Y. Mort. But at his looks, Lightborn, thou wilt relent.    34: Mortimer tests Lightborn: "oh, I am sure that when you

    36   Light. Relent? ha, ha! I use much to relent.                   36: there seems to be a joke here by Lightborn, not

                                                                           down = the first quarto prints through here, but the later

    44   To pierce the windpipe with a needle's point;
         Or, whilst one is asleep, to take a quill                      = small tube.1
    46   And blow a little powder in his ears:                          = ie. poison; Tancock notes the popularity of murder by
                                                                           poison in the 16th century.7

         Or open his mouth, and pour quicksilver down.                  47: open = emended by Dyce to ope' for the sake of the

    48   But yet I have a braver way than these.                        = "an even better way than these to kill him."

    52   Light. Nay, you shall pardon me; none shall know my            52: the audience was expected to understand this vague

         Y. Mort. The prince I rule, the queen do I command,           75f: Mortimer, alone, reviews his situation: he is finally the
                                                                          undisputed chief man of England.
    76   And with a lowly congè to the ground,                         = congee, ie. bow.
         The proudest lords salute me as I pass;
    78   I seal, I cancel, I do what I will.                           78: seal = use the great Seal to issue official documents.1
                                                                          cancel = annul legal documents.1
         Feared am I more than loved; − let me be feared,
    80   And when I frown, make all the court look pale.               = ie. from fear.

         I view the Prince with Aristarchus' eyes,                     81-82: Aristarchus was a 2nd century B.C. grammarian and
    82   Whose looks were as a breeching to a boy.                     schoolmaster who had a reputation for being a severe
                                                                       critic.11 Mortimer imagines him as a strict instructor, whose
                                                                       glance at a quivering pupil had the same effect as a whipping
                                                                       (breeching).
                                                                           Aristarchus' most lasting legacy was the dividing of the
                                                                       Iliad and Odyssey into 24 books each.

         They thrust upon me the protectorship,                        83: with Kent out of the way, Mortimer became the young
                                                                          king's Protector.

                                                                          Actually, Mortimer never held any formal positions in
                                                                       young Edward's administration, but all the key posts were
                                                                       held by his lackeys, so that he was the de facto ruler of
                                                                       England.

    84   And sue to me for that that I desire.                         84: the king's Council begged Mortimer to be the Protector,
                                                                          which is what he wanted anyway.

         While at the council-table, grave enough,                     85-88: Mortimer describes the false modesty with which he
                                                                          affected to be unqualified to accept the role of Protector.

    86   And not unlike a bashful Puritan,                             86: bashful = "hypocritically modest", a trait often assigned

    90   Suscepi that provinciam as they term it;                      = Latin: "I accept that office or position." 6
         And to conclude, I am Protector now.
    92   Now is all sure: the queen and Mortimer                       = secure.

          Sold. 'A would have taken the king away perforce,            = he. = forcibly.
    134   As we were bringing him to Killingworth.
    136   Y. Mort. Did you attempt his rescue, Edmund? speak.
    138   Kent. Mortimer, I did; he is our king,
          And thou compell'st this prince to wear the crown.

                                                               110�

          Y. Mort. Strike off his head! He shall have martial law.        = ie. a military trial.

          Kent. Strike off my head! base traitor, I defy thee!
    144
          Edw. III. My lord, he is my uncle, and shall live.
    146
          Y. Mort. My lord, he is your enemy, and shall die.
    148
          Kent. Stay, villains!                                           = stop.

          Edw. III. Sweet mother, if I cannot pardon him,
    152   Entreat my Lord Protector for his life.
    154   Q. Isab. Son, be content; I dare not speak a word.
    156   Edw. III. Nor I, and yet methinks I should command;
          But, seeing I cannot, I'll entreat for him −                    ="beg for his life."
    158   My lord, if you will let my uncle live,
          I will requite it when I come to age.                           = repay.
    160
          Y. Mort. 'Tis for your highness' good, and for the realm's. −
    162   How often shall I bid you bear him hence?                       162: to the guards: "how many times do I have to tell you

    164   Kent. Art thou king? must I die at thy command?
    166   Y. Mort. At our command. − Once more away with him.
    168   Kent. Let me but stay and speak; I will not go.
          Either my brother or his son is king,
    170   And none of both them thirst for Edmund's blood:                = "neither of them".
          And therefore, soldiers, whither will you hale me?              = drag.

    174
          Edw. III. What safety may I look for at his hands,              175-6: Edward addresses Isabella.
    176   If that my uncle shall be murthered thus?
    178   Q. Isab. Fear not, sweet boy, I'll guard thee from thy foes;
          Had Edmund lived, he would have sought thy death.
    180   Come, son, we'll ride a-hunting in the park.
    182   Edw. III. And shall my uncle Edmund ride with us?               182: Briggs notes the inconsistency of the new king's por-

         ACT V, SCENE V.
         A hall in Berkeley Castle.

                                      Enter Matrevis and Gurney.
    1    Mat. Gurney, I wonder the king dies not.
    2    Being in a vault up to the knees in water,
         To which the channels of the castle run,                       = sewers.
    4    From whence a damp continually ariseth,
         That were enough to poison any man,
    6    Much more a king brought up so tenderly.                       6: Edward was tall and unusually strong, and seems to have
                                                                        surprised his keepers with his ability to survive the harsh
                                                                        treatment heaped on him.6
    8    Gurn. And so do I, Matrevis: yesternight
         I opened but the door to throw him meat,                       = food.
    10   And I was almost stifled with the savour.                      = smell.

    12   Mat. He hath a body able to endure
         More than we can inflict: and therefore now
    14   Let us assail his mind another while.                          = "again for a bit."

    16   Gurn. Send for him out thence, and I will anger him.           = from (in) there.

    18   Mat. But stay, who's this?                                     = hold on.

    20                                          Enter Lightborn.
    22   Light.               My Lord Protector greets you.
    24                                                [Gives letter.]
    26   Gurn. What's here? I know not how to conster it.               = construe, ie. interpret; Gurney, reading the letter, is
                                                                           confused by the lack of punctuation.

    28   Mat. Gurney, it was left unpointed for the nonce:              = unpunctuated. = for the occasion, ie. deliberately.
         “Edwardum occidere nolite timere.”
    30   That's his meaning.                                            29-30: as Mortimer hoped, Matrevis interprets the letter's
                                                                           meaning as "fear not to kill the king." See Act V.iv.9-14.
    32   Light. Know you this token? I must have the king.
    34                                                [Gives token.]
    36   Mat. Ay, stay awhile, thou shalt have answer straight.         = "hold on for a moment". = right away.
         [Aside to Gurney]
    38   This villain's sent to make away the king.                     = murder.

    40   Gurn. [Aside] I thought as much.

                                                              112�

    42   Mat.         [Aside] And when the murder's done,
         See how he must be handled for his labour.                   = dealt with.

    44   Pereat iste! Let him have the king. −                        = Latin: "Let him perish himself." The Latin instruction is
                                                                      included in the letter, and Matrevis immediately understands
                                                                      its meaning: kill Lightborn after he has disposed of the king.

         What else? Here is the keys, this is the lake,               45: What else? = "Of course!"
                                                                          Here is the keys = in this era, keys could be referred to in

    46   Do as you are commanded by my lord.                          = ie. Mortimer.

    48   Light. I know what I must do. Get you away,
         Yet be not far off, I shall need your help;
    50   See that in the next room I have a fire,
         And get me a spit, and let it be red-hot.
    52
         Mat. Very well.
    54
         Gurn. Need you anything besides?
    56
         Light. What else? A table and a feather-bed.                 = mattress filled with feathers.14
    58
         Gurn. That's all?
    60
         Light. Ay, ay; so, when I call you, bring it in.
    62
         Mat. Fear not thou that.
    64
         Gurn. Here's a light, to go into the dungeon.                = torch.
    66
                      [Gives a light, and then exit with Matrevis.] 69: Dyce suggests there is a change of scene to the dungeon
    68                                                                where Edward is kept; perhaps Lightborn pulls back a
                                                                      curtain to reveal the miserable quarters of the king.8
                                                                      Tancock, on the other hand, posits that Edward climbs up
                                                                      from out of the dungeon, and the scene simply continues. 7
         Light. So now
    70   Must I about this gear; ne'er was there any                  = business. = anyone.
         So finely handled as this king shall be.
    72   Foh, here's a place indeed, with all my heart!               72: Lightborn is impressed by Edward's bleak surroundings!

    74   K. Edw. Who's there? what light is that? wherefore           = why.
            comes thou?
    76   Light. To comfort you and bring you joyful news.
    78   K. Edw. Small comfort finds poor Edward in thy looks.
         Villain, I know thou com'st to murther me.
    80
         Light. To murther you, my most gracious lord!
    82   Far is it from my heart to do you harm.
         The queen sent me to see how you were used,                  = being treated.
    84   For she relents at this your misery:
         And what eyes can refrain from shedding tears,
    86   To see a king in this most piteous state?

                                                             113�

    88    K. Edw. Weep'st thou already? list a while to me,           = listen.
          And then thy heart, were it as Gurney's is,
    90    Or as Matrevis', hewn from the Caucasus,                    90: Matrevis' heart is as hard as if it had been cut from the
                                                                         Caucasus Mountains.
          Yet will it melt, ere I have done my tale.                  = finished.
    92    This dungeon where they keep me is the sink
          Wherein the filth of all the castle falls.                  92-93: in a medieval castle, the "toilets" were up against one
    94                                                                inner wall, and all the waste would fall to a sewer below.
                                                                      The rebuilt Langley Castle, now a luxury hotel in

                                                                      available for inspection.
          Light. O villains!
    96
          K. Edw. And there in mire and puddle have I stood
    98    This ten days' space; and, lest that I should sleep,        = for fear that.1
          One plays continually upon a drum.
    100   They give me bread and water, being a king;                 = ie. "though I am".7
          So that, for want of sleep and sustenance,                  = lack.
    102   My mind's distempered, and my body's numbed,                = deranged or disturbed.
          And whether I have limbs or no I know not.
    104   O, would my blood dropped out from every vein,
          As doth this water from my tattered robes.
    106   Tell Isabel, the queen, I looked not thus,                  = "I didn't look like this".
          When for her sake I ran at tilt in France,                  = ie. "jousted (on her behalf)". Actually, Edward did not
                                                                         have much of a penchant for participating in tournaments.
    108   And there unhorsed the Duke of Clerèmont.                   108: the title was of a French noble.

    110   Light. O speak no more, my lord! this breaks my heart.
          Lie on this bed, and rest yourself a while.                 = it is unclear when the feather-bed of line 57 is brought in;

    114   I see my tragedy written in thy brows.                      114: a nice bit of theatrical self-reference.
          Yet stay; awhile forbear thy bloody hand,

          I feel a hell of grief! Where is my crown?

    140   Light. You're overwatched, my lord; lie down and rest.          = exhausted from being awake too long.2

    142   K. Edw. But that grief keeps me waking, I should sleep;         = "if not for the grief that".
          For not these ten days have these eye-lids closed.
    144   Now as I speak they fall, and yet with fear

          K. Edw. Something still buzzeth in mine ears,

          This fear is that which makes me tremble thus.
    164   And therefore tell me, wherefore art thou come?                 = why.

    26   Q. Isab. Ah, Mortimer, the king my son hath news                26-27: Gurney has already spilled the beans about the king's
         His father's dead, and we have murdered him!                       murder; another example of Compression of Time.
    28
         Y. Mort. What if we have? The king is yet a child.

         Ay me! see where he comes, and they with him.

    46   Edw. III. Think not that I am frighted with thy words!
         My father's murdered through thy treachery;
    48   And thou shalt die, and on his mournful hearse
         Thy hateful and accursèd head shall lie
    50   To witness to the world, that by thy means
         His kingly body was too soon interred.
    52
         Q. Isab. Weep not, sweet son!
    54
         Edw. III. Forbid not me to weep; he was my father;
    56   And had you loved him half so well as I,
         You could not bear his death thus patiently.
    58   But you, I fear, conspired with Mortimer.

         Who is the man dares say I murdered him?
    64
         Edw. III. Traitor! in me my loving father speaks,
    66   And plainly saith, 'twas thou that murdered’st him.
    68   Y. Mort. But hath your grace no other proof than this?
    70   Edw. III. Yes, if this be the hand of Mortimer.              = handwriting.

    80   Edw. III. That thither thou didst send a murtherer.          = to there.

    82   Y. Mort. What murtherer? Bring forth the man I sent.
    84   Edw. III. Ah, Mortimer, thou knowest that he is slain;
         And so shalt thou be too − Why stays he here?                = ie. "is Mortimer still here? get him out of here!"

          Q. Isab. As thou received'st thy life from me,
    112   Spill not the blood of gentle Mortimer!
    114   Edw. III. This argues that you spilt my father's blood,     = ie. "is evidence".

           Additionally, at some point Berkeley actually appointed
           Gurney to watch over the king.
               In late March or the first day or so of April, Mortimer
           supposedly sent one William Ockley with instructions to
           Edward's jailers to "remedy the situation". A day or so after
           Ockley's arrival, the king's death was announced. It was
           Gurney who was sent by Berkeley to inform Parliament of
           the old king's death. It was stated that Edward died "of
           natural causes."
               After Mortimer's fall in 1330, Gurney, Ockley, and
           another obscure figure, Sir Simon Bereford, were convicted
           for the murder of Edward II; Maltravers was condemned to
           die for his leading role in the trial, conviction and execution
           of the Earl of Kent, but not Edward's death. Bereford was
           executed in December 1330.
               Gurney and Maltravers escaped to the continent before
           their sentences could be carried out. Gurney was later
           discovered and arrested in Spain in 1331, escaped, and was
           found and arrested again in Naples in 1333. Impoverished
           and ill, Gurney died before he could be brought back to
           England.
               Maltravers' story is more interesting: never arrested,
           Maltravers instead ended up working for Edward III in
           Flanders, eventually submitting to and being received by the
           king, and even officially pardoned for his role in Kent's
           death in 1351. His lands returned to him, Maltravers lived
           out his life in England, dying in 1364.
               The fate of Ockley is unknown: if he was executed, no
           record of the fact is extant. Berkeley was acquitted of all
           charges, and went on to live until 1361. The great leniency
           shown by Edward III toward the murderers of his father was
           exceptional (Warner, Regicide etc., Part Two).33

                       Marlowe's Invented Words.
        Like all writers of the era, Christopher Marlowe made up words when
    he felt like it, usually by adding prefixes and suffixes to known words,
    combining words, or using a word in a way not yet used before. The
    following is a list of words and phrases that research suggests first
    appeared in Edward II:
                      A. Words and Compound Words.
                    asseize (meaning "seize", unconfirmed)
              balk, baulk (meaning to disappoint, unconfirmed)
                         brisk (meaning finely dressed)
                               buckler (as a verb)
                                    curate-like
                                    Midas-like
                      mushroom (referring to an upstart)
                    my stars (as an expression of surprise)
                         or else (still the modern phrase
                        implying a threat, unconfirmed)
                                     over-woo
                                   port-master
                                 savage-minded
                                   sword-proof
                                         tanti
                                     targeteer
                                   too-piercing
                                 top-branch(es)
                                      top-flag
                          torpedo (applied to a person)
           tune (figuratively meaning to bring two people or things
                                  into harmony)
                                   velvet-caped
                      B. Expressions and Collocations.
       Collocations are words that are commonly, conventionally and
    familiarly used together (e.g. "blue sky"), but which when used
    collectively so do not rise to the level of what may be called an
    expression. All of the following expressions and collocations make
    their first appearance in Edward II, and were subsequently used by later
    writers, and some even continue to be used this day.
       Those collocations in quotation marks indicate an exactly worded
    formula that was reused regularly by later writers. Also, the words one,
    one's, and oneself are used as proxies for any pronoun, e.g. the entry
    "pull one's house down" represents all variations including "pull my
    house down", "pull your house down", etc.
                          "advance your standard"
                             "aims at thy life"
                                "air of life"
                             "base flatterer(s)"
                              "bliss on earth"
                           "bound everlastingly"
                              "bowl of poison"
                            "bowmen and pikes"

                 C. Words and Expressions Incorrectly
                   Credited to Marlowe by the OED.
        The OED cites Edward II as being the publication containing the
    earliest use of the following words; however, research has shown that
    the OED is not correct in giving Marlowe credit for using these words
    first, ie. all of them appeared in works published before 1590.
                                    gloomy
                                   goat-feet
                      heavy-headed (meaning stupid)
         hooded (used to describe a garment, rather than a person)
                   Hymen (first use in English literature)
                                light-brained
     manent (as a stage direction, meaning to remain on stage, applied to
                            more than one person)
                                 night-grown
          nook and/or corner (a predecessor to nook and cranny)
                                  overdaring
